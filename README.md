TASK ONE:
Create a simple ToDoList app that users to addd , edit , delete the tasks. Implement features like task priorities, due dates and task completion status.

Project Overview

The To-Do List App is a simple and effective task management application designed to help users organize their daily activities. This project was developed using Flutter and written in Dart, with Visual Studio Code (VS Code) serving as the primary integrated development environment.

Development Highlights

1.Flutter Framework: Leveraged for its rich widget library and seamless cross-platform development capabilities.

2.VS Code: Used as the IDE for writing, debugging, and managing the project files, with extensions for Flutter and Dart enhancing the workflow.

3.Minimal Git Repository: Only essential files like main.dart and pubspec.yaml were uploaded to the Git repository since the remaining files (such as Flutter's built-in configurations and auto-generated files) were excluded to keep the repository clean and concise.


File Structure

1.lib/main.dart: Contains the core logic and UI design for the app.

2.pubspec.yaml: Manages project dependencies and metadata.

3.Other autogenerated and configuration files are not included in the repository but are required for Flutter's proper functioning. These files are created automatically when the project is run locally.

Objectives
The To-Do List App is a productivity tool that helps users efficiently manage their tasks. Key objectives include:

1.Allowing users to create, update, and delete tasks.

2.Enabling users to mark tasks as completed.

3.Providing the ability to set due dates for tasks.

4.Offering a user-friendly interface for seamless task management.


Features Implemented

1. Task Management:
   
      Add new tasks with a title and optional due date.
   
      View all tasks in a structured list.
   
      Mark tasks as completed or delete them if no longer needed.
   
2. Mark Tasks as Completed:
   
     Users can toggle tasks between "completed" and "not completed" states.
   
     Completed tasks are visually distinguished for clarity.
   
3.Due Date Feature:
      Users can set and view due dates for their tasks.
      
5. User Interface:
      Clean and intuitive UI with distinct sections for pending and completed tasks.
   
     Action buttons for task creation, deletion, and toggling completion status.

How the Code Works

1.Task Representation:
    Each task is represented as an object containing a title, status (completed or not), and an optional due date.
    
2.State Management:
   Tasks are stored in a list managed within the app state.
   
   State updates dynamically as tasks are added, updated, or removed.
   
3.UI Components:
   The ListView widget displays tasks in a scrollable list.
   
   Buttons and icons allow task interactions like marking as completed or deleting.
